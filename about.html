                Let me introduce myself as Aswin V P, a technical enthusiast, quick learner, tenacious, and decisive individual. I graduated in electrical engineering from Mohandas College, completing my studies in 2022. During my time in college, I actively participated in various extracurricular activities, including being a member of the college robotics club, where I honed my skills in designing and building innovative projects. Currently, I excel in my role as a hardware developer at Acutro Technologies, leveraging my passion for technology and my ability to quickly grasp new concepts. I thrive in challenging situations, and my tenacity allows me to overcome obstacles and find effective solutions. My decisive nature enables me to make informed decisions and take decisive actions, ensuring efficient progress in my work. In addition to my professional commitments, I am also serving as a Python intern at Oneteam Solutions, which provides me with valuable opportunities to further expand my knowledge and skills in software development. I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the industry. With my technical proficiency, passion for learning, and determination, I am poised for continued growth and success in my career as I strive to make meaningful contributions to the field of electrical engineering and software development. Outside of work, I have a loving and supportive family consisting of my father, mother, and a younger sister. Their encouragement and support have been instrumental in my achievements. In my leisure time, I indulge in my hobbies, including photography and editing. I find joy in capturing moments and scenes through my lens, and I love the creative process of editing, adding my personal touch to my photographs. Additionally, I am an avid movie watcher and enjoy exploring different genres. Movies allow me to immerse myself in captivating storytelling and broaden my perspectives. These hobbies serve as a way for me to unwind, express my creativity, and appreciate the art of visual storytelling.
